# Common Development Questions
This page should answer many common development questions in bukkit/spigot/paper (and java)

# Read the docs!
~~Contrary to popular belief~~ docs can help answer many questions you have!

[Spigot Docs](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/index.html)

[Java Docs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/index.html)

# Java Conventions
You should follow the java conventions when writing code.

This helps readability & allows future developers/maintainers to read the code.

I recommend following the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
